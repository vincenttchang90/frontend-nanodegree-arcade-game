===============================
SUMMARY

A clone of the classic frogger arcade game, written to practice OOP for Udacity's Frontend Web Dev Nanodegree.

HOW TO PLAY

Make sure you have download all files. When ready open index.html and use the arrow keys to move the player around. The goal is to get to the river.

Good luck!

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
